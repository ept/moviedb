Start by downloading the data files:

    $ wget -l 1 -r ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/pub/misc/movies/database/

Put the downloaded `*.list.gz` files in the `lists` subdirectory of this repository. Then make sure
Postgres is running locally, and import the data with the following script:

    $ ./import.sh

It first compiles the parser, then parses the list files and writes parsed output to the `dbs`
directory. It then loads those files into Postgres, and performs various data cleaning and
restructuring tasks there.



How mkdb works:

For movies.list:
count = processMoviesList ( titles, &titleCount, &attrCount ) ;

For actors.list and actresses.list:
listCount = processCastList ( &nameCount, titles, &titleCount, &attrCount, i, moviesOnly, nochar ) ;

For writers.list:
listCount = processWriterFilmographyList ( &nameCount, titles, &titleCount, &attrCount, i, moviesOnly ) ;

For all other lists:
listCount = processFilmographyList ( &nameCount, titles, &titleCount, &attrCount, i, moviesOnly ) ;



Other IMDB parser implementations:

* [imdb-data-parser](https://github.com/dedeler/imdb-data-parser) (very incomplete and doesn't quite parse correctly)
* [imdb2json](https://github.com/oxplot/imdb2json)
* [IMDbPY](http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/)
